API MEANS...and what it does

API – Meaning

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

What does an API do?
An API allows two software systems to communicate with each other.

It acts like a messenger:
You send a request → API delivers it to the server
Server processes it → API returns the result back to you

Easy Real-Life Example

When you order food on Zomato:
App sends request to server through API
Server returns restaurant list → API brings it back to the app
API = Waiter who takes your order and brings your food.

Technical View

APIs:

Define how software can interact (rules, format, methods)

Enable data exchange using methods like GET, POST (HTTP calls)

Hide internal complexity of systems

Why APIs are important
Benefit	Explanation
Integration	Connect different apps (ex: payment gateway in e-commerce)
Automation	Systems communicate without manual work
Security	Expose only required data—not entire database
Reusability	Same API can serve web, mobile, chatbot, etc.
One-Line Answer for Interviews

“API is an interface that allows two applications to communicate with each other.
 It takes a request from a client and returns a response from the server, enabling integration and 
data sharing.”

GET
“GET is used to retrieve data from the server. The data is passed via parameters in the URL.”

POST
“POST is used to send data to the server in the request body and usually modifies or processes information.”

Request
“A request is how a client asks a server for information or sends data.”

Response
“A response is the server’s reply containing the result of that request.”

# api code--

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app=FastAPI()

# GET API: Add two numbers
@app.get("/add")
def add(a:int,b:int):
    result = a+b
    return {"operation": "addition", "result": result}

# Request body for POST API
class MultiplyInput(BaseModel):
    x: int
    y: int

# POST API: Multiply two numbers
@app.post("/multiply")
def multiply(input_data: MultiplyInput):
    result = input_data.x * input_data.y
    return {"operation": "multiplication", "result": result}

“Pydantic is a data validation library used by FastAPI to validate and structure request data.
 It ensures that the incoming JSON has the correct fields and data types before processing.”
